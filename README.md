# HelloNana

Video Call Application, easily usable by elderly people.

It is a project on which I collaborated with 3 other colleagues for the Human-Computer Interaction course.

We were positively graded and our project got approved by our professor **Dr. Matja≈æ Kljun**.

During our development, we were monitored and advised by our assistant professor **Cuauhtli Campos Mijangos**.

We conducted user tests, surveys, and different design sprints for our project. In the end, we created a **high-fidelity prototype** for our application.

We made sure to follow all **UI/UX heuristics and rules**, and we wrote a **critical report** of our project.

# Key Features: 
- **Simplified UI**: Large buttons, clear icons, and minimal distractions for easy navigation.
- **Voice Commands**: Enables users to start and end calls using simple voice commands.
- **One-Tap Calling**: Avoids complex menus, allowing seniors to connect with family instantly.
- **Accessibility Features**: Adjustable text size, color contrast options, and support for hearing impairments.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Adheres to UI/UX heuristics and usability principles for an optimal experience.
